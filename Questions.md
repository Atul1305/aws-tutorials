**1. What is Amazon EC2?**
EC2 is short for Elastic Compute Cloud, and it provides scalable computing capacity. <br>
Using Amazon EC2 eliminates the need to invest in hardware, leading to faster development and deployment of applications. <br>
You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as needed, configure security and networking, <br>
and manage storage. It can scale up or down to handle changes in requirements, reducing the need to forecast traffic. <br>
EC2 provides virtual computing environments called “instances.”

2. What Are Some of the Security Best Practices for Amazon EC2?
Security best practices for Amazon EC2 include using Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to AWS resources; restricting access by only allowing trusted hosts or networks to access ports on an instance; only opening up those permissions you require, and disabling password-based logins for instances launched from your AMI.

3. What is Amazon S3? 
S3 is short for Simple Storage Service, and Amazon S3 is the most supported storage platform available. S3 is object storage that can store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. Despite that versatility, it is practically unlimited as well as cost-effective because it is storage available on demand. In addition to these benefits, it offers unprecedented levels of durability and availability. Amazon S3 helps to manage data for cost optimization, access control, and compliance. 

4. Can S3 Be Used with EC2 Instances, and If Yes, How?
Amazon S3 can be used for instances with root devices backed by local instance storage. That way, developers have access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites. To execute systems in the Amazon EC2 environment, developers load Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) into Amazon S3 and then move them between Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2.

Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 are two of the best-known web services that make up AWS.

5. What Is Identity and Access Management (IAM) and How Is It Used?
Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service for securely controlling access to AWS services. IAM lets you manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users and applications can access.
